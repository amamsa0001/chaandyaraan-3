 India's moon rover just avoided a treacherous crater
</h2>

<p>
   India's moon rover is proving to be a scrappy, resilient space explorer.

    While cruising the dark and craggy lunar terrain at the south pole region Sunday, Pragyan came within 10 feet of a crater plenty big enough to swallow the whole buggy.
    
    It was a close call, but the rover's navigation cameras spotted the crater, about 13 feet wide, just in time. Pragyan was then commanded to retrace its path to avoid the hazard, according to the Indian Space Research Organization, India's version of NASA.

     It's now safely heading on a new path," the space agency said Monday

    The success of Chandrayaan-3, which means "moon craft" in Hindi, places India among the former Soviet Union, United States, and China: global superpowers-turned-spacefarers who have landed on the moon 239,000 miles away. The victory comes four years after India's Chandrayaan-2 mission crashed attempting the same feat of landing near the moon's south pole.

    India's accomplishment follows mere days after the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, lost its Luna-25 robotic spacecraft in a crash. The dueling Indian and Russian missions were each trying to set their crewless spacecraft down near the south pole last week.
